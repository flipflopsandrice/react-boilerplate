## Commands

Check out `package.json` for other useful NPM scripts.

### Development

Run a webpack-dev-server with `npm start`.

### Linting

Use `npm run lint` to run ESLint. It adheres to the Airbnb styleguide.

### Testing

Add component tests to `src/app/__tests__` and run *Jest* with `npm run test`.

### Building

Webpack publishes the bundle into *dist* when running `npm run build`.
